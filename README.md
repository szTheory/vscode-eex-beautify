# EEx Formatter/Beautify

Most of solution that exist in the internet is tell you to create a task and call it using ctrl-shift-p menu.

This extension basically using [htmlbeautifier](https://github.com/threedaymonk/htmlbeautifier) to format your file using the Formatter API from the vscode, so no need to create a hack using Task, etc.

## Features

## Requirements

```
gem install htmlbeautifier
```

NOTE: For you that have a filename with extension `.html.eex`, your file might be recognized as `html` file, not as `eex` file. In that case, add a setting in your `settings.json` like below:

```json
"files.associations": {
  "*.eex": "eex"
}
```

If the above broke your syntax highlighting, try this instead:

```json
"files.associations": {
  "*.eex": "HTML (EEx)"
}
```
